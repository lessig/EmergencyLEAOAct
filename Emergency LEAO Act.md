### **Proposed Statute**

**The Commonwealth of Massachusetts**

**In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty-Six**

**AN ACT ESTABLISHING AN EMERGENCY LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT ACT.**

*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:*

**SECTION 1\.** The General Laws are hereby amended by inserting after Chapter 6E the following chapter:

**CHAPTER 6F. EMERGENCY ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT MISCONDUCT**

**Section 1\. Purpose and Legislative Findings.**

(a) The General Court finds that in extraordinary circumstances, standard judicial and internal disciplinary mechanisms may fail to restrain pattern-or-practice violations of law by armed state or federal agents.

(b) It is the intent of this chapter to establish a purely administrative remedy, exercised under the plenary police power of the Executive, to preserve the peace during such emergencies. The bodies and officers described herein shall function exclusively as executive administrative agencies and shall not be construed as "courts" for purposes of federal removal statutes.

**Section 2\. Definitions.**

As used in this chapter, the following words shall have the following meanings:

"Administrative Officer" shall mean the Executive Director of the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission established under Chapter 6E, or their designee.

"CAJ" shall mean the Citizen Assembly Jury.

"Commission" shall mean the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission.

"Illegal Rogue Behavior" (IRB) shall mean specific acts defined in an Emergency Declaration that clearly violate the Constitution of the United States (regarding federal officers) or the laws and Constitution of the Commonwealth (regarding state officers), based on clearly established law.

"Law Enforcement Force or Entity" shall mean any organized collection of any officers of the United States or the Commonwealth who are empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of federal or state law.

**Section 3\. Governor’s Emergency Declaration.**

(a) The Governor may invoke the procedures of this chapter upon a finding that a **law enforcement force or entity** operating within the Commonwealth has gone rogue and that ordinary control mechanisms have broken down.

(b) The Declaration must:

(1) Specify reasons why the emergency process is appropriate;

(2) Cite particular instances of rogue behavior;

(3) Define the specific class of cases constituting IRBs;

(4) Cite authority establishing that such IRBs constitute clearly established violations of law; and

(5) Specify the duration of the emergency, not to exceed six months.

(c) **Attorney General Review.** The Declaration shall not take effect until reviewed by the Attorney General. The Attorney General shall confirm the Governor’s judgment if satisfied that the identified IRBs clearly violate applicable law.

(d) **Judicial Review.** Once confirmed, the Declaration may be reviewed by the Supreme Judicial Court on an expedited basis. The Court shall not disturb the Declaration unless the Governor’s findings are clearly erroneous. No other court of the Commonwealth shall have jurisdiction to review the validity of the Declaration **or any other action arising out of this Chapter**.

**Section 4\. Administrative Procedure and Detention.**

(a) Upon activation, the Administrative Officer shall publicly post the list of IRBs and open a secure, web-based portal for the submission of complaints, written statements, and digital evidence by legal residents of the Commonwealth.

(b) **Probable Cause and Administrative Detention.** Upon a determination by the Administrative Officer that a complaint establishes probable cause that an officer has committed an IRB:

(1) The Administrative Officer shall issue an **Administrative Detention Order** for the immediate apprehension and confinement of the respondent officer.

(2) The Division of State Police shall execute this order within 24 hours.

(3) This detention is civil and administrative in nature, intended to secure the presence of the officer for emergency adjudication and to prevent further public harm.

(c) **Severability of Detention Authority.** The General Court finds that during a declared emergency, the executive power to detain rogue actors is essential to public safety. If the power of the Administrative Officer to issue detention orders is held unconstitutional, such holding shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this chapter.

**Section 5\. The Citizen Assembly Jury (CAJ).**

(a) Within 24 hours of detention, the respondent officer shall be presented to a CAJ.

(b) **Composition.** The CAJ shall consist of twelve citizens randomly selected from the lists maintained by the Office of Jury Commissioner pursuant to Chapter 234A.

(c) **Service.** Service on the CAJ is mandatory.

(1) Members shall be compensated at a rate of $500 per day.

(2) Service shall not exceed five consecutive days.

(3) Employers are prohibited from retaliating against employees for service; time served shall be deducted from accrued vacation.

(4) Retaliation against a CAJ member by any person shall constitute a felony punishable by imprisonment for not less than five years.

**Section 6\. Adjudicatory Proceedings and Rights of the Respondent.**

(a) **Procedural Rights of the Respondent.**

(1) **Notice and Discovery.** No less than 12 hours prior to the convening of the CAJ, the Administrative Officer shall provide the Respondent with a written notice of the specific IRB alleged and a copy of all evidence, statements, and digital records submitted by the complainant or gathered by the Administrative Officer.

(2) **Right to Counsel.** The Respondent shall have the right to be represented by counsel or a union representative at their own expense during all proceedings before the CAJ.

(3) **Right to Be Heard.** The Respondent shall have the specific right to testify on their own behalf, to call witnesses, and to submit exculpatory evidence.

(4) **Confrontation.** The Respondent or their counsel may question the complainant and any witnesses presented by the Administrative Officer. The Administrative Officer may limit such questioning if it becomes repetitive, harassing, or irrelevant to the specific IRB alleged.

(b) **Conduct of the Hearing.**

(1) **Presiding Officer.** The Administrative Officer shall preside over the hearing to ensure order and efficiency but shall not vote on the factual findings.

(2) **Format.** The hearing shall proceed as follows:

(i) The Administrative Officer shall present the evidence of the violation.

(ii) The Respondent may present their defense and evidence.

(iii) Both parties may offer brief closing statements to the CAJ.

(3) **Evidentiary Rules.** **A proceeding under this section** shall not be bound by the strict rules of evidence applicable in courts of law. The Administrative Officer shall admit any evidence that is probative and relevant, including hearsay if deemed reliable, consistent with the standard for administrative agencies under Chapter 30A.

(4) **Public Nature.** All proceedings under this section shall be open to the public, unless the Administrative Officer makes a specific finding that confidentiality is required to protect the safety of a witness or the integrity of an ongoing investigation.

(c) **Deliberation and Standard of Proof.**

(1) The CAJ shall deliberate in private.

(2) To support a finding of violation, a majority of the CAJ must find that the evidence establishes, by **clear and convincing evidence**, that the Respondent committed the specific IRB alleged.

(3) The CAJ shall issue a written finding of facts, which shall be binding on the Administrative Officer.

(d) **Imposition of Penalty.**

(1) Upon a factual finding of violation by the CAJ, the Administrative Officer shall issue a Final Order of Noncompliance.

(2) The Officer shall immediately impose a penalty of not less than $1,000 and not more than $10,000.

(3) **Seizure and Forfeiture.** The Administrative Officer shall order the immediate seizure of personal property of the officer, including personal vehicles and cellular telephones, sufficient to satisfy the penalty. If the penalty is not paid immediately, the seized property shall be summarily forfeited to the Commonwealth to satisfy the debt.

**Section 7\. Defenses and Privileges.**

(a) **Abrogation of Common Law Immunities.** In any proceeding under this chapter, no defense of qualified immunity, official immunity, or good faith reliance on generally applicable statutes shall be available to the Respondent. The finding by the Governor and Attorney General that an IRB constitutes a violation of clearly established law shall be conclusive for purposes of this administrative adjudication.

(b) **Preservation of Constitutional Privileges.** Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to abrogate any privilege or right guaranteed to the Respondent by the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the Commonwealth, including the privilege against self-incrimination. The invocation of such privileges shall not be the basis for an adverse inference against the Respondent in the determination of guilt, though it may preclude the Respondent from offering testimony on related matters.

**Section 8\. Status of Adjudicatory Body.**

(a) **Non-Judicial Nature.** The administrative process established under this chapter, including the Citizen Assembly Jury and the proceedings presided over by the Administrative Officer, shall typically and legally constitute an executive function of the Commonwealth.

(b) **Exclusion from Judiciary.** Notwithstanding any other provision of the General Laws, including Chapter 211, Chapter 211B, or Chapter 212:

(1) The proceedings authorized herein are **not** proceedings in a "State court" as defined by the Constitution of the Commonwealth or the General Laws;

(2) The Administrative Officer and the Citizen Assembly Jury are **not** judicial officers or bodies; and

(3) This chapter shall not be construed to vest judicial power in the Commission, but rather to exercise the Executive’s plenary power to maintain order and discipline public officers.

(c) **Construction.** In any dispute regarding jurisdiction or removal, this section shall be controlling proof of the Commonwealth’s intent that these proceedings are exclusively administrative agency actions and not civil or criminal actions within a State court.

**Section 9\. Exclusive Remedy and Preclusion of Review.**

(a) **Administrative Appeal.** Judgments may be appealed solely to a designated Commissioner within the Commission. The Commissioner shall reverse the judgment only if it is clearly erroneous.

(b) **Court Stripping.** Notwithstanding the provisions of Chapter 30A or any other law:

(1) The administrative procedure established herein shall constitute the full extent of process due to the respondent officer.

(2) No court of the Commonwealth, other than the limited review provided in Section 3(d), shall have jurisdiction to review, stay, or enjoin the findings of the CAJ, the Administrative Detention Order, or the imposition of penalties under this chapter.

### **Explanation Guide: Emergency Law Enforcement Accountability and Oversight Act**

This guide explains the provisions of the Act and how they operationalize the "converse-1983" strategy to ensure accountability while preventing federal removal.

#### **1\. The Strategic Architecture: Agency vs. Court**

The central premise of this statute is to prevent federal officers from utilizing the federal officer removal statute to escape state accountability.

* **The Obstacle:** Under 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), a civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in a "State court" against a federal officer may be removed to federal court.  
* **The Solution:** This statute vests enforcement power entirely within an executive administrative agency (the POST Commission). As noted by Akhil Amar, the text of the removal statute explicitly applies to "State courts." By creating a procedure that is textually and functionally "administrative," the Commonwealth aims to fail the prima facie requirement for removal. *See* Akhil Reed Amar, *Using State Law to Protect Federal Constitutional Rights: Some Questions and Answers about Converse-1983*, 64 U. Colo. L. Rev. 159, 178 (1993).  
* **Section 8 (Statutory Disclaimer):** This section acts as a "poison pill" for removal by explicitly defining the body *out* of the state court system. A federal judge wishing to permit removal would have to rule that the state legislature cannot define its own branches of government.

#### **2\. Triggering the Emergency (Section 3\)**

* **Targeted Scope:** The statute applies to any "law enforcement force or entity," defined broadly to capture both state police and federal agencies (like ICE) operating within the Commonwealth.  
* **Qualified Immunity Pre-Check:** The requirement that the Governor and AG pre-identify "Illegal Rogue Behaviors" (IRBs) based on "clearly established law" serves to strip the officer of the defense that they could not have known their conduct was unlawful. *See generally* Joanna C. Schwartz, *How Qualified Immunity Fails*, 127 Yale L.J. 2 (2017).  
* **Judicial Review Limitation:** Section 3(d) now explicitly bars state courts from reviewing not just the Declaration, but **"any other action arising out of this Chapter."** This drastic measure is intended to funnel all challenges through the internal administrative appeal process, preventing state judges from issuing stays or injunctions that would delay the emergency response.

#### **3\. Administrative Detention (Section 4\)**

* **Why "Administrative Detention"?** We explicitly avoid the term "arrest" to distinguish this from criminal procedure. This creates a parallel to civil immigration detention or quarantine powers.  
* **Severability:** Because executive detention without judicial warrant is constitutionally aggressive, Section 4(c) ensures that if a court strikes down the *pre-hearing detention* aspect, the rest of the adjudication machinery remains intact.

#### **4\. The Citizen Assembly Jury & Due Process (Sections 5 & 6\)**

* **Due Process Shield:** Section 6 expands procedural rights (counsel, discovery, confrontation) to satisfy the *Mathews v. Eldridge* test for administrative due process. This insulates the statute from claims that it is a "lawless" kangaroo court, while still distinguishing it from a criminal trial.  
* **Public Access:** Section 6(b)(4) ensures these proceedings are public, increasing transparency and trust, though the Administrative Officer retains discretion to close the session for safety reasons.  
* **Evidentiary Standard:** By using administrative standards (allowing reliable hearsay) rather than criminal rules of evidence, the statute further reinforces the "Agency" definition over the "Court" definition.

#### **5\. Defenses and Privileges (Section 7\)**

* **Abrogation of Immunity:** Section 7(a) ensures that common-law defenses like Qualified Immunity cannot be reintroduced by the officer during the hearing. Since the IRB is already defined as a violation of clearly established law, the immunity defense is rendered legally irrelevant by statute.  
* **Retention of Privilege:** Section 7(b) creates a necessary "safety valve." By explicitly retaining the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, the statute avoids a facial constitutional challenge that could strike the whole law down.

#### **6\. Summary Forfeiture (Section 6(d))**

* **Immediate Seizure:** The statute converts the fine into a debt immediately satisfied by property. This bypasses the often years-long delay of collecting judgments described in Schwartz's research on indemnification. *See* Joanna C. Schwartz, *Police Indemnification*, 89 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 885 (2014).  
* **The Cell Phone:** Seizing the personal phone serves a dual functional purpose: it satisfies the monetary penalty (as an asset) and immediately disrupts the rogue officer's ability to communicate or coordinate off-channel.
